SeviBus is a non-profit, independent, unofficial application for public transportation in Seville, Spain. The app allows users to check bus arrival times, view routes on a map, manage favorite stops, and even check Bonob√∫s card balances using NFC.

Available since 2010, SeviBus was the first public transportation application for Sevilla. It has been continuously updated and maintained over the years, embracing modern design principles and development practices with each iteration to provide the best possible experience for users.
